    "\n",
    "When examining the [academic journal](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/tagged/academic-journal) page in Overleaf templates, you'll see that official templates of many different journals are shared on Overleaf. Writing articles using the templates shared by journals will make it possible to quickly ensure formal compliance. In fact, some journal templates have a \"Submit to journal\" link, so you can submit to the journal directly through Overleaf once you've completed writing your article.\n",

    "* Abstract and other sections\n",

The text given in `\\caption` will be added as a description below the figure, according to the journal's template.
