    "text": "LaTeX (more formally shown as $ $) is a document preparation system and markup language that is widely used for typesetting scientific, technical, and mathematical documents. It is based on the TeX typesetting system developed by Donald Knuth and is particularly suited for creating complex, structured documents such as theses, dissertations, research papers, and books. LaTeX allows users to focus on the content of their document, rather than its layout, by providing a set of markup commands that can be used to define the structure and formatting of the text. This results in professional-quality output with precise control over typography, spacing, and layout, making it a popular choice among academics, researchers, and publishers."

Or, if you want to add an image to your text you can drag and drop the image to your document. And then you can move around the image on the page.\n\n\nThis is very practical and efficient for small documents but becomes an disadvantage for documents like thesis, books, research papers, etc.\nLaTeX has very different approach.
