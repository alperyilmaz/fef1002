    "text": "This module will cover the following concepts:\n\nHistory of Excel\nExcel Interface and Screen Elements\nData Entry and Editing\nExcel Error Codes\nShortcuts\nSorting, Filtering, Conditional Formatting\nWriting Functions in Excel\nTables and Charts in Excel\n\n\n\nExcel is a spreadsheet program. The Excel program keeps all kinds of data in tables or lists and provides the ability to perform all the calculations and analyses you need with this data.\nNote: Excel has 1,048,576 rows, 16,384 columns, and 17,179,869,184 cells :)\nMicrosoft released the first version of Excel in 1985. Here are the versions of Excel released to date:\n\n1987 Excel 2.0 for Windows\n1990 Excel 3.0\n1992 Excel 4.0\n1993 Excel 5.0 (Office 4.2 & 4.3)\n1995 Excel for Windows 95 (version 7.0)\n1997 Excel 97 (version 8.0)\n1999 Excel 2000 (version 9.0)\n2001 Excel 2002 (version 10)\n2003 Office Excel 2003 (version 11)\n2007 Office Excel 2007 (version 12)\n2010 Excel 2010 (version 14)\n\n\n\n\nTo run Excel, type Excel in the Run Command Line and press Enter (You can use the Windows+R key combination for the Run Command Line). Below is the Excel program window.\n\nIn Excel, files are called “Workbooks”. Workbooks consist of sheets, and sheets consist of cells. When we save workbooks to our computer, the file extension is “xlsx”.\n\n(Source: https://blog.excel751.com)\nQuick Access Toolbar: This ribbon contains commands shown in tabs. The purpose here is to gather the most used commands together to make operations faster and more accessible. This ribbon can be customized according to the person’s requirements.\nTabs: These are the main headings where formulas, designs, and fonts are located. There are 10 tabs visible on the screen. These are: File, Home, Insert, Draw, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, View, and Help tabs.\nApart from these, there is one more tab that you can add from Excel’s settings. This tab is called Developer. More coding is done here. You can access information about how to activate this tab and about the tab by clicking the link.\nGroups: Each tab contains commands. Commands with the same function are grouped together. Thus, multiple groups are created in each tab.\nTitle Bar: This is the area where the file name is written.\nSearch Bar: You can search for anything (command, feature, formula, template, etc.) in Excel by typing it here.\nUser Information: This is the section where the name, surname, and profile photo of the user logged in with a Microsoft Excel account are located.\nFormula Bar: The user performs operations (writing formulas, four operations, data entry, etc.) in the formula bar.\nGridlines: These are the lines created to define the areas of cells formed by row and column intersections.\nCell: This is where a row and column intersect. Data entries, formulas, etc. are made in this area. Excel has 17,179,869,184 cells.\nColumn headers are expressed with letters, and row headers with numbers. The cell that is clicked once with the mouse indicates the cell we will start working on actively and is marked with a black frame by Excel.\nRow: This is the area where row numbers are written. It starts from 1 and continues incrementing by 1. Operations such as row insertion can be performed in this area.\nColumn: This is the area where column numbers are located. It starts from A and continues according to alphabetical order. Operations such as new column insertion can be performed in this area.\nName Box: This is a section where the location of the selected cell, table name, or name of the defined area is written.\nSelect All: When this command is pressed, all cells in the Excel screen are selected.\nWorksheets: This is the area where users enter data and use formulas and features/commands when needed.\nAdd Sheet: When the user wants to switch to a new worksheet, they should click the + sign in the marked area shown in the image above.\nStatus Bar: This option displays the current cell editing mode at the bottom left of the screen. These cell editing modes are; General, Content, Cell, Formula.\nScroll Bars: These are bars used to easily scroll the page right/left or up/down in the workspace.\nPage Zoom In-Out: If you want to zoom in or out of your worksheet, you can use the buttons in this area. The zoom in/out operation performed on this page is specific to that page only. In other words, the same scale zoom in or out is not performed on other pages.\nNormal Page: This command, located in the bottom right corner of the Excel workspace, is one of Excel’s most well-known and used page layouts.\nPage Layout: When this command is clicked, the section related to Excel’s print area welcomes us. In this command, cells that can fit in the printing area are shown. The user can change this layout if desired.\nPage Break Preview: This command allows you to view Excel’s print area before printing. No changes or editing can be made here.\n\n\n\n\nData entry into an Excel cell can be started directly from the keyboard. The text will be visible both in the cell and in the formula bar. When you finish typing in the cell, you need to press the ENTER key on the keyboard for the change to be permanent. If only text is written, you can also use the arrow keys or tab key to move to other cells. However, if a formula is written, the Enter key must be used.\n\n\n\nLet’s type “hello, welcome to our lesson” as shown below and press Enter, the screen will look like this. To adjust the cell width, bring the mouse between A and B columns, and when the pointer takes the shape of (+), drag it to the right and release. We can also do thiswith a double click. We can use the same method to adjust row height.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent ways: * Double click inside the cell and make sure the cursor enters the cell. The cell content is ready to be modified * Press F2 key when the cell is selected, and with this action, the cursor enters the cell. The cell content is ready to be modified * Click on the formula bar. The cell content is ready to be modified\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you right-click on a cell and select “Format Cells”, the Format Cells window appears. This window is useful for formatting cells into a specific format.\n\nSome options are defined below:\nGeneral: The default number format Excel applies when you type a number. Numbers formatted with General format are usually displayed exactly as you type them. However, if the cell is not wide enough to show the entire number, the General format rounds decimal numbers.\nNumber: Used for general display of numbers. You can determine the number of decimal places you want to use, whether you want to use a thousands separator, and how you want to display negative numbers.\nPercentage: Multiplies the cell value by 100 and displays the result with a percentage symbol (%). You can determine the number of decimal places you want to use.\nDate: Displays date and time serial numbers as date values according to the type and locale (location) you specify. Date formats that begin with an asterisk (*) respond to changes in regional date and time settings in Control Panel. Formats without an asterisk are not affected by Control Panel settings.\nText: Accepts cell content as text and displays it exactly as you type it, even when you type numbers.\n\n\n\n\nControls the alignment of text within the cell. Under the Orientation heading, you can give any direction to the text in the cell as desired.\n\n\n\n\nUsed to change the character style of text within the cell. The same options are available in the toolbar. (In Home-&gt;)\n\n\n\n\nThe lines around cells in the Excel worksheet are virtual. These lines are not visible when printed. To make the lines visible, you need to add “Borders” around the cells. Using the line styles under the Style heading, you can make desired changes. Also, border colors can be changed under the “Color” heading.\n\n\n\nUsed to change the background colors of cells.\n\n\n\n\nIf desired, cells can be locked to prevent data editing. Locking can also be done from Review-&gt;Protect Sheet option.\n\nNote: All of the above operations can also be done from the “Home” tab. If you click on the area marked in yellow, the formatting window will open automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen working in Excel, you start encountering different errors when you begin using formulas. Here are common errors in Excel:\n1. #NAME? Error: This error occurs when using an incorrectly written or undefined variable in the formula. It appears when you write the cell address or formula name incorrectly.\n\n\n\n\n2. #VALUE! Error: This error occurs when using the wrong data type in a formula. For example, you encounter this error when trying to add a number value with a text value.\n\n\n3. #DIV/0! Error: This error occurs when performing a division by zero operation in a formula. You encounter this error when you divide a number by a Zero value.\n\n\n4. #REF! Error: This is the most common error code in Excel. It gives this error when the target cell is invalid. You get a #REF! error when the targeted rows, columns, or cells have been deleted because that cell or address no longer exists.\nFor example, in the example below, the sum of Revenues is taken in cell C10. Normally, the formula written there is SUM(C5:C9). When you paste this formula into cell F4, cell copying operation takes effect as 6 rows up. However, there is no cell before row 1. In such a case, you get a #REF! error.\n\n5. #N/A Error: If no value is found in the written formula, you get a #N/A Error. This error is usually caused by space characters and incorrect spellings. The functions where #N/A errors are most commonly encountered are VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, LOOKUP, MATCH. All of thesefunctions perform a search operation, and when they cannot find the relevant value, they return #N/A.\nFor example, let’s find what position Öykü is in the list. However, since there is no information about Öykü in the table, a #N/A erroris received.\n=MATCH(Lookup_value;Lookup_array;Match_type)\nLookup_value: The value you want to search for in the specified cell range. Can be a number, text, or cell reference\nLookup_array: The cell range where the specified value will be searched\nMatch_type: There are 3 matching options: * 1-Less than: Returns the first value that is equal to or less than the searched value. When using this match type, the looked-up cellrange must be sorted in ascending order. For example, 0,1,2,3… or A to Z * 0-Exact Match: Finds the data that exactly matches the searched value. The looked-up cell range can be in random order * -1 Greater than: Returns the first value that is equal to or greater than the searched value. When using this match type, the looked-up cell range must be sorted in ascending order. For example, 3,2,1,0… or Z to A\n\n\n\n\n6. #NUM! Error: Excel receives a #NUM! error in situations where it cannot perform calculations.\nFor example, you’ll get this error when trying to take the square root of a negative number.\n\n\n7. ####### Error Codes: Normally ### (hash) is not an error. If the cell width is not enough to show the content inside, it shows as ####. When you widen the column, the data will be visible.\n\n\n8. #NULL! Error: The #NULL Error usually gives this error when using a space character instead of Colon or semicolon characters when addressing cells for a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtrl+N: Opens a new excel workbook\nCtrl+X: Used for cutting\nCtrl+C: Used for copying\nCtrl+V: Used for pasting\nDelete: Deletes selected cell content\nCtrl+Z: Undoes action\nCtrl+Y: Redoes action\nCtrl+A: Select All\nCtrl+9: Hide Row\nCtrl+0: Hide Column\nCtrl+S: Save\nF12: Save As\nCtrl+F: Find\nCtrl+H: Find and Replace\nCtrl+Right arrow (→): Rightmost of row\nCtrl+Left arrow (←): Leftmost of row\nCtrl+Up arrow (↑): Top row\nCtrl+Down arrow (↓): Bottom row\nAlt+Down arrow (↓): Show other data entries\nCtrl+Home: Go to cell A1\nCtrl+Shift+Down/Up Arrow: When used by clicking on a specific data to the bottommost or topmost cell, selects all filled cells\nCtrl+Shift+Right/Left Arrow: When used by clicking on a specific data to the rightmost or leftmost cell, selects all filled cells\nShift+Space: Selects entire row\nCtrl+Space: Selects entire column\nCtrl+Page Up/Down: Switches between worksheets\nF11: Creates a column chart based on selected data (on a separate sheet)\nAlt+F1: Creates a column chart based on specific data (on the same sheet)\nCtrl+S: Saves changes in the workbook\nAlt+F4: Closes Excel\nand…\nESC: Exit from the active cell"

    "text": "This module will cover the following concepts:\n\nHistory of Excel\nExcel Interface and Screen Elements\nData Entry and Editing\nExcel Error Codes\nShortcuts\nSorting, Filtering, Conditional Formatting\nWriting Functions in Excel\nTables and Charts in Excel\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting data is an integral part of data analysis. You might want to organize a name list in alphabetical order, compile a product stock levels list from highest to lowest, or sort rows by colors or icons. Sorting data helps you better see and understand your data, find and organize the data you want, and ultimately make much more effective decisions.\n\n\n\nSelect a cell in the column you want to sort.\nIn the Data tab, in the Sort and Filter group, do one of the following:\nFor quick ascending order sorting, click the A to Z command (Sort A to Z) which sorts in Excel from A to Z or from smallest to largest number.\nFor quick descending order sorting, click the Z to A command (Sort Z to A) which sorts in Excel from Z to A or from largest to smallest number.\n\n\n\n\nSelect a cell in the column you want to sort.\nIn the Data tab, in the Sort and Filter group, do one of the following:\nTo sort from smallest to largest, click the A to Z command (Sort Smallest to Largest) which sorts in Excel from smallest to largest number.\nTo sort from largest to smallest, click the Z to A command (Sort Largest to Smallest) which sorts in Excel from largest to smallest number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use the sample Excel file ornek1.xlsx for the following samples.\n\nLet’s enter the following data and find all cells with the name Esra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s filter those younger than 18 in the same example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional formatting can help make patterns and trends in your data more apparent. It works with the logic of if… then…. If cell content has a specific value according to certain criteria, that cell’s formatting changes according to the selected option or any format you desire. You can change formatting elements such as cell background color, borders, fonts, and you can also display icons in the cell. In other words, it allows you to see values that are more important or special to you more easily at first glance. You can even use it for error checking; for example, in a formula that multiplies values from different cells for a subtotal, you can use formatting that will quickly show you cells that don’t return values.\n\n\n\nAs shown below, you can select one of the preset formats in cell highlighting rules or create custom formatting.\nThe formatting option includes “Greater Than”, “Less Than”, “Between”, “Equal To”, “Text Contains”, “Date” and “Duplicate Value”. For example, when “Duplicate” is clicked, an additional window appears with a dropdown box where you can select “Duplicate” or “Unique” options to format repeated values or unique values.\n\nFor example, let’s highlight those over 18 years old\n\nSimilarly, let’s highlight those under 18 years old\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this option, you can select self-explanatory preferences including top 10, top 10%, bottom 10, bottom 10%, below average, and above average in your selected range.\nLet’s highlight the data above average\n\n\nSimilarly, to highlight repeated or unique values, you just need to select other rules option.\n\n\n\n\nData bars fill cells with horizontal bar graphs according to the values in your selected range, with the largest value filling the entire cell horizontally and other values scaled proportionally in comparison.\nIf you click on Other Rules, you can apply formatting according to your own preferences or formula through a form. Additionally, you can modify the fill and border of the bars within cells to create custom formatting.\n\n\n\n\nThis option creates a scale between the largest and smallest values in your selected range and adjusts the cell fill color according to the scale between two colors you choose.\n\n\n\n\nIcon sets show different symbols next to the value in the cell indicating which range the value falls into based on a scale between the largest and smallest values in your selected range. You can create rules and assign icons according to your rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you need to enter sequential numbers like serial numbers in a table, instead of typing these numbers one by one manually, we can enter them using the auto-fill method. For this:\n\nEnter the first two sequence numbers in cells either vertically or horizontally.\nSelect these two cells, starting with the cell containing the first number.\nTake the mouse pointer to the fill handle (small dot) in the bottom right corner of the selected area (mouse pointer becomes a small plus), hold down the left mouse button and drag down or to the side.\n\nNote: You determine the rule. If the first two cells contain 2 and 4, you will create numbers increasing by 2.\n\n\n\n\nYou can perform calculations using formulas in Excel tables. When entering a formula into a cell, you need to pay attention to the following:\n\nFormulas start with = sign\nNo spaces should be given when writing formulas (except for text in quotes within the formula)\nThe number of opening parentheses should match the number of closing parentheses\nConstant numbers, cell names, and range names can be used when writing formulas\nF2 key is used to edit the formula\nDELETE key is used to delete the formula\nESC key is used to exit the formula\nFormulas can be replicated\nAddition and multiplication operations have functions. However, division and subtraction operations don’t have functions\nColon: Includes the cell range in the operation. For example, if A2:A8, all cells from A2 to A8 are included in the operation\nSemicolon; Only includes those specific cells in the operation. Does not take the range. For example, if A2;A8, only A2 and A8 are included in the operation\nIf the value in the formula is a number, it is written directly. For example; A2=50\nIf the value in the formula is a word, it is written in quotes. For example; A2=“female”\nDuring formula replication, cell fixing can be done to prevent cell changes. Press F4 key to fix a cell. Or it can be fixed by writing manually.\n\n\nSource: HANIFE BOZKURT BATMAN\nAddition Operation\n=SUM(A1:A10) Performs Addition Operation. Adds Cells from A1 to A10.\n\nMultiplication Operation\n=PRODUCT(A1:A10) Performs Multiplication Operation. Multiplies Cells from A1 to A10. \n=AVERAGE(A1:A10) Calculates Average. Finds the Average of Cells from A1 to A10.\n=MAX(A1:A10) Finds the Largest Number. Finds the Highest Number in Cells from A1 to A10.\n=MIN(A1:A10) Finds the Smallest Number. Finds the Smallest Number in Cells from A1 to A10.\n=SMALL(A1:A10;2) Returns the SMALL number in the Range. However, which small number is required must be specified in the formula. Finds the 2nd smallest number from A1 to A10.\n=LARGE(A1:A10;3) Returns the LARGE number in the Range. However, which large number is required must be specified in the formula. Finds the 3rd largest number from A1 to A10.\n=ROW(A1) Returns the Row Number of the Cell.\n=COLUMN(A1) Returns the Column Number of the Cell.\n=LOWER(A1) Converts Text in Cell to Lowercase.\n=UPPER(A1) Converts Text in Cell to Uppercase.\n=PROPER(A1) Capitalizes the First Letters of Text in Cell.\n=CONCATENATE(A1;A2) Writes Values from Two Cells Side by Side, Combines Them.\n=TEXT(A1;“000”) Converts the Value in Cell to Text, Adds Zeros at the Beginning.\n=TEXT(A1;“DDDD”) If the Value in Cell is a Date, Returns the Day of the Week.\n=LEN(A1) Returns the Number of Characters in Cell Value.\n=INT(A1) Removes Everything After the Decimal Point in Cell’s Decimal Number. Converts to Integer.\n=ROUND(A1;1) Rounds the Decimal Places After the Decimal Point According to the Digit Value in the Formula.\n=ROUNDUP(A1;0) Rounds Up the Decimal Places After the Decimal Point to the Next Number.\n=ROUNDDOWN(A1;0) Rounds Down the Decimal Places After the Decimal Point to the Previous Number.\n=QUOTIENT(B2;C2) Is Division Operation. B2: Represents Numerator C2: Represents Denominator. Gives Quotient. Doesn’t Show Remainder.\n=MOD(B2;C2) B2: Represents Dividend, C2: Represents Divisor. Gives Remainder. Doesn’t Show Quotient.\n=COUNTBLANK(B2:B8) Returns Number of Empty Cells. Finds How Many Empty Cells There Are from B2 to B8.\n=COUNTA(B2:B8) Returns Number of Non-Empty Cells. Finds How Many Non-Empty Cells There Are from B2 to B8.\n=COUNT(B2:B8) Returns Number of Cells Containing Numbers. Finds How Many Cells Contain Numbers from B2 to B8.\n=COUNTIF(B2:B12;“Female”) Finds How Many of the Searched Value Exist. Finds How Many Cells Contain “Female” from B2 to B12.\n\nYou can use ornek2a.xlsx file for the following examples\n\n\nCOUNTIFS(B2:B12;“Female”;C2:C12;“&gt;18”) Finds How Many Match Multiple Search Criteria. Finds How Many Cells Contain “Female” Value from B2 to B12 AND Are Greater Than 18 from C2 to C12.\n\n=SUMIF(B2:B12;“Female”;C2:C12) Finds the Sum of the Range That Matches the Search Value. Finds the Sum of the Range from C2 to C12 Corresponding to Cells Containing “Female” from B2 to B12.\n\n=SUMIFS(C2:C12;A2:A12;“Sevgi”;B2:B12;“Female”) Finds the Sum of the Range That Matches Multiple Search Values. This formula sums the ages of those named Sevgi and who are Female.\n\n=AVERAGEIF(B2:B12;“Female”;C2:C12) Calculates the Average of Values Corresponding to Cells That Match the Search Criteria. Finds “Female” Values from B2 to B12 And Calculates the Average of Their Corresponding Values from C2 to C12.\n=AVERAGEIFS(C2:C12;A2:A12;“Sevgi”;B2:B12;“Female”) Calculates the Average of Values Corresponding to Cells That Match Multiple Search Criteria. Finds “Female” Values. Finds “Sevgi” Values. Takes Average of Ages.\n\n\n\n\nThis function allows for evaluating outcomes based on whether a condition is met or not.\nUsage format: =IF(condition;true result;false result)\ncondition can be written by comparing a cell with a number or comparing values of two cells.\ntrue result is the expression or value to be written when the condition is met.\nfalse result is the expression or value to be written when the condition is not met.\nLet’s Look at the Examples Below.\nWe assigned label 1 to True Result and 0 to False Result. After writing the first function, we can copy the same function for other cells by dragging the cells.\n\n\nWe assigned “Can Vote” to True Result and “Cannot Vote” to False Result. After writing the first function, we can copy the same function for other cells by dragging the cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you need to check multiple conditions in an IF function, you can use AND operator or OR operator. If you want all multiple conditions to be met for a positive result in the IF function, use the AND operator; if meeting just one of the conditions is sufficient, write the formula with the OR operator.\nLet’s add another column to the above table (Mental Status)\nIf age is 18 and mental status is sound, they can vote. That is, both conditions must be met.\n\nYou can use file ornek2b.xlsx for the following examples\n\n\n\nIf age is 18 or mental status is sound, they can vote. Meeting one condition is sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say we have students and their grades. We want to show students who got:\n\n80 - 100 as “Very Good”\n60 - 79 as “Good”\n40 - 59 as “Average”\n20 - 39 as “Poor”\n0 - 19 as “Very Poor”\n\nLet’s examine the following function:\n=IF(B2&gt;=80;“Very Good”;IF(B2&gt;=60;“Good”;IF(B2&gt;=40;“Average”;IF(B2&gt;=20;“Poor”;“Very Poor”))))\n\nYou can use file ornek3.xlsx for the following examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcel Pivot table is a method used to quickly create reports from list-formatted data and compare data. Pivot Tables, one of Excel’s most frequently used features, are extensively used in creating Reporting screens.\nPivot Tables, where we can create reports by dragging and dropping table headers into row and column areas, have become an even more powerful and indispensable Excel feature with the features developed with new Excel versions. Pivot Tables have a very wide usage area, from comparing monthly sales values of salespeople to reporting monthly expenses of vehicles, and are an indispensable tool in managers’ Excel usage.\nThere are certain conditions for creating a Pivot Table from Excel data:\n\nYour data must be listed downward in columns.\nShould not contain empty rows or columns.\nWhen you create a Pivot Table from a table with continuous data entry, when you add a new row and refresh the data, your Pivot Table automatically updates.\nData types in columns should be of the same type. For example, if a column has a date header, that column should only contain date values.\n\nLet’s look at the following example\n\nYou can use file ornek4.xlsx for the following examples\n\n\nResearch Question: How many sales were made in each region?\nInsert–&gt;Pivot Table–&gt;Select Table/Range option and select all data range.\n\nWhen you select the desired information from the Pivot Table fields on the right side, the pivot table appears.\n\nIn this pivot table, for example, 125 sales were made in Adana. If you click on 125, you can see the details of the sales on a separate page.\n\nResearch Question: How many sales were made by region and month, and what is the total amount?\n\nYou can choose the row and column yourself. For example, we click on the brand on the right and drag it to row instead, so it separates by brands. When you select brand and price, a table like below can be created.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three basic chart types you can create in Excel, and they’re all very suitable for specific data types:\nLine - Displays one or more data sets using vertical bars. Can be used to list changes over time or compare two similar data sets\nColumn - Displays one or more data sets using horizontal lines. Can be used to show growth or decline in data over time\nPie - Displays a data set as parts of a whole. Can be used to show the visual distribution of data\nLet’s consider the following data set. We can create a chart by selecting all data and using the Insert–&gt;Recommended Charts tab.\n\nYou can use file ornek5.xlsx for the following examples\n\n\n\n\nFrom chart elements, adjustments can be made to the chart.\n\n\nLet’s try a different chart for the example above.\nSelect and copy the row containing dates and paste it to a different area using special paste–&gt;transpose\nRepeat the same process by selecting the apple row.\nAfterward, we can select the pie chart and modify the data labels as desired."

Can be used to list changes over time or compare two similar data sets\nColumn - Displays one or more data sets using horizontal lines. Can be used to show growth or decline in data over time\nPie - Displays a data set as parts of a whole. Can be used to show the visual distribution of data\nLet’s consider the following data set. We can create a chart by selecting all data and using the Insert–&gt;Recommended Charts tab.\n\nYou can use file ornek5.xlsx for the following examples\n\n\n\n\nFrom chart elements, adjustments can be made to the chart.\n\n\nLet’s try a different chart for the example above.\nSelect and copy the row containing dates and paste it to a different area using special paste–&gt;transpose\nRepeat the same process by selecting the apple row.\nAfterward, we can select the pie chart and modify the data labels as desired."

It is based on the TeX typesetting system developed by Donald Knuth and is particularly suited for creating complex, structured documents such as theses, dissertations, research papers, and books. LaTeX allows users to focus on the content of their document, rather than its layout, by providing a set of markup commands that can be used to define the structure and formatting of the text. This results in professional-quality output with precise control over typography, spacing, and layout, making it a popular choice among academics, researchers, and publishers."
