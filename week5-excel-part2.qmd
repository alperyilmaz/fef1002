## Sorting, Filtering, Conditional Formatting

### Sorting

Sorting data is an integral part of data analysis. You might want to organize a name list in alphabetical order, compile a product stock levels list from highest to lowest, or sort rows by colors or icons. Sorting data helps you better see and understand your data, find and organize the data you want, and ultimately make much more effective decisions.

### Text Sorting

Select a cell in the column you want to sort.

In the Data tab, in the Sort and Filter group, do one of the following:

For quick ascending order sorting, click the A to Z command (Sort A to Z) which sorts in Excel from A to Z or from smallest to largest number.

For quick descending order sorting, click the Z to A command (Sort Z to A) which sorts in Excel from Z to A or from largest to smallest number.

### Number Sorting

Select a cell in the column you want to sort.

In the Data tab, in the Sort and Filter group, do one of the following:

To sort from smallest to largest, click the A to Z command (Sort Smallest to Largest) which sorts in Excel from smallest to largest number.

To sort from largest to smallest, click the Z to A command (Sort Largest to Smallest) which sorts in Excel from largest to smallest number.

### Filtering

#### Filtering an Entire Column

> Please use the sample Excel file [ornek1.xlsx](files/ornek1.xlsx) for the following samples.

Let's enter the following data and find all cells with the name Esra.

#### Filtering Specific Numbers

Let's filter those younger than 18 in the same example

### Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting can help make patterns and trends in your data more apparent. It works with the logic of if... then.... If cell content has a specific value according to certain criteria, that cell's formatting changes according to the selected option or any format you desire. You can change formatting elements such as cell background color, borders, fonts, and you can also display icons in the cell. In other words, it allows you to see values that are more important or special to you more easily at first glance. You can even use it for error checking; for example, in a formula that multiplies values from different cells for a subtotal, you can use formatting that will quickly show you cells that don't return values.

### Cell Highlighting Rules

As shown below, you can select one of the preset formats in cell highlighting rules or create custom formatting.

The formatting option includes "Greater Than", "Less Than", "Between", "Equal To", "Text Contains", "Date" and "Duplicate Value". For example, when "Duplicate" is clicked, an additional window appears with a dropdown box where you can select "Duplicate" or "Unique" options to format repeated values or unique values.

![](images/resim41.png)

For example, let's highlight those over 18 years old

![](images/resim38.png)

Similarly, let's highlight those under 18 years old

![](images/resim39.png)

![](images/resim40.png)

### Top/Bottom Rules

With this option, you can select self-explanatory preferences including top 10, top 10%, bottom 10, bottom 10%, below average, and above average in your selected range.

Let's highlight the data above average

![](images/resim42.png)

![](images/resim43.png)

Similarly, to highlight repeated or unique values, you just need to select other rules option.

![](images/resim44.png)

### Data Bars

Data bars fill cells with horizontal bar graphs according to the values in your selected range, with the largest value filling the entire cell horizontally and other values scaled proportionally in comparison.

If you click on Other Rules, you can apply formatting according to your own preferences or formula through a form. Additionally, you can modify the fill and border of the bars within cells to create custom formatting.

![](images/resim45.png)

### Color Scales

This option creates a scale between the largest and smallest values in your selected range and adjusts the cell fill color according to the scale between two colors you choose.

![](images/resim46.png)

### Icon Sets

Icon sets show different symbols next to the value in the cell indicating which range the value falls into based on a scale between the largest and smallest values in your selected range. You can create rules and assign icons according to your rules.

## Writing Functions in EXCEL

### Entering Data Series

When you need to enter sequential numbers like serial numbers in a table, instead of typing these numbers one by one manually, we can enter them using the auto-fill method. For this:

* Enter the first two sequence numbers in cells either vertically or horizontally.
* Select these two cells, starting with the cell containing the first number.
* Take the mouse pointer to the fill handle (small dot) in the bottom right corner of the selected area (mouse pointer becomes a small plus), hold down the left mouse button and drag down or to the side.

**Note:** You determine the rule. If the first two cells contain 2 and 4, you will create numbers increasing by 2.

![](images/resim48.png)

### Formula Creation

You can perform calculations using formulas in Excel tables. When entering a formula into a cell, you need to pay attention to the following:

* Formulas start with = sign
* No spaces should be given when writing formulas (except for text in quotes within the formula)
* The number of opening parentheses should match the number of closing parentheses
* Constant numbers, cell names, and range names can be used when writing formulas
* F2 key is used to edit the formula
* DELETE key is used to delete the formula
* ESC key is used to exit the formula
* Formulas can be replicated
* Addition and multiplication operations have functions. However, division and subtraction operations don't have functions
* Colon: Includes the cell range in the operation. For example, if A2:A8, all cells from A2 to A8 are included in the operation
* Semicolon; Only includes those specific cells in the operation. Does not take the range. For example, if A2;A8, only A2 and A8 are included in the operation
* If the value in the formula is a number, it is written directly. For example; A2=50
* If the value in the formula is a word, it is written in quotes. For example; A2="female"
* During formula replication, cell fixing can be done to prevent cell changes. Press F4 key to fix a cell. Or it can be fixed by writing manually.

![](images/resim56.png)

### IF Function

This function allows for evaluating outcomes based on whether a condition is met or not.

Usage format: **=IF(condition;true result;false result)**

**condition** can be written by comparing a cell with a number or comparing values of two cells.

**true result** is the expression or value to be written when the condition is met.

**false result** is the expression or value to be written when the condition is not met.

Let's Look at the Examples Below.

We assigned label 1 to True Result and 0 to False Result. After writing the first function, we can copy the same function for other cells by dragging the cells.

![](images/resim57.png)

![](images/resim58.png)

We assigned "Can Vote" to True Result and "Cannot Vote" to False Result. After writing the first function, we can copy the same function for other cells by dragging the cells.

![](images/resim59.png)

![](images/resim60.png)

### AND and OR Operators

When you need to check multiple conditions in an IF function, you can use AND operator or OR operator. If you want all multiple conditions to be met for a positive result in the IF function, use the AND operator; if meeting just one of the conditions is sufficient, write the formula with the OR operator.

Let's add another column to the above table (Mental Status)

If age is 18 and mental status is sound, they can vote. That is, both conditions must be met.

> You can use file [ornek2b.xlsx](files/ornek2b.xlsx) for the following examples

![](images/resim61.png)

![](images/resim62.png)

If age is 18 or mental status is sound, they can vote. Meeting one condition is sufficient.

![](images/resim63.png)

![](images/resim64.png)

### Nested IF

Let's say we have students and their grades. We want to show students who got:

* 80 - 100 as "Very Good"
* 60 - 79 as "Good"
* 40 - 59 as "Average"
* 20 - 39 as "Poor"
* 0 - 19 as "Very Poor"

Let's examine the following function:

=IF(B2>=80;"Very Good";IF(B2>=60;"Good";IF(B2>=40;"Average";IF(B2>=20;"Poor";"Very Poor"))))

## Tables and Charts in EXCEL

### Pivot Tables

Excel Pivot table is a method used to quickly create reports from list-formatted data and compare data. Pivot Tables, one of Excel's most frequently used features, are extensively used in creating Reporting screens.

Pivot Tables, where we can create reports by dragging and dropping table headers into row and column areas, have become an even more powerful and indispensable Excel feature with the features developed with new Excel versions. Pivot Tables have a very wide usage area, from comparing monthly sales values of salespeople to reporting monthly expenses of vehicles, and are an indispensable tool in managers' Excel usage.

There are certain conditions for creating a Pivot Table from Excel data:

* Your data must be listed downward in columns.
* Should not contain empty rows or columns.
* When you create a Pivot Table from a table with continuous data entry, when you add a new row and refresh the data, your Pivot Table automatically updates.
* Data types in columns should be of the same type. For example, if a column has a date header, that column should only contain date values.

Let's look at the following example

> You can use file [ornek4.xlsx](files/ornek4.xlsx) for the following examples

![](images/resim69.png)

**Research Question: How many sales were made in each region?**

Insert-->Pivot Table-->Select Table/Range option and select all data range.

![](images/resim70.png)

When you select the desired information from the Pivot Table fields on the right side, the pivot table appears.

![](images/resim71.png)

In this pivot table, for example, 125 sales were made in Adana. If you click on 125, you can see the details of the sales on a separate page.

![](images/resim72.png)

**Research Question: How many sales were made by region and month, and what is the total amount?**

![](images/resim73.png)

You can choose the row and column yourself. For example, we click on the brand on the right and drag it to row instead, so it separates by brands. When you select brand and price, a table like below can be created.

![](images/resim74.png)

### Charts

There are three basic chart types you can create in Excel, and they're all very suitable for specific data types:

Line - Displays one or more data sets using vertical bars. Can be used to list changes over time or compare two similar data sets

Column - Displays one or more data sets using horizontal lines. Can be used to show growth or decline in data over time

Pie - Displays a data set as parts of a whole. Can be used to show the visual distribution of data

Let's consider the following data set. We can create a chart by selecting all data and using the Insert-->Recommended Charts tab.

> You can use file [ornek5.xlsx](files/ornek5.xlsx) for the following examples

![](images/resim75.png)

![](images/resim76.png)

![](images/resim77.png)

From chart elements, adjustments can be made to the chart.

![](images/resim78.png)

![](images/resim79.png)

Let's try a different chart for the example above.

Select and copy the row containing dates and paste it to a different area using special paste-->transpose

Repeat the same process by selecting the apple row.

Afterward, we can select the pie chart and modify the data labels as desired.
